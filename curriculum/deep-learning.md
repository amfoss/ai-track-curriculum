# ðŸ¤– Deep Learning

**ðŸ“… Expected Duration:** 8 weeks

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks to learn patterns directly from data, eliminating manual feature engineering and excels at automatically extracting features for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing. This section covers the necessary material for you to study and work on, to take a solid step into Deep Learning. Beginners **must** finish the Machine Learning section first, before starting this section.

By the end of this section, you will be able to

1. Understand neural networks and their architectures
2. Implement and train models using PyTorch
3. Apply deep learning techniques for different tasks
4. Optimize models using hyperparameters, regularization, and learning rate schedulers
5. Analyze loss curves and metric curves to evaluate the models.

**ðŸ“Œ Tasks**

1. Computer Vision Course by Stanford University\
   Learn the theoretical foundations of neural networks covering everything from basic architectures to CNNs and RNNs. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) for the YouTube playlist.\

2. Learn PyTorch\
   The official [PyTorch tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html) are a great start. Learn the practical aspects of deep learning by completing all submodules in "Learn the Basics" section, understanding PyTorch components and implementing training pipelines from scratch. You can do this in parallel with the Computer Vision Course **after you have completed up to lecture 5**\
   \
   Kaggle notebooks for practising and learning PyTorch:\

**Additional Reading Material**

Books serve very well in painting the big picture and helping beginners understand the whys and hows. The books listed below cover foundational topics in deep learning. However, it's important not to spend too much time reading the books, you can go through the chapters as required or the ones you find interesting. Note that it is **not mandatory** to read them.

1. [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/index.html) (Recommended)
2. [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)
3. [Oreillyâ€™s Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhUJ_INt1RXzrpEZs4PNs59YWVWtbro5/view?usp=sharing)
