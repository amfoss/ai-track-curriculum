# ðŸš€ Project

**ðŸ“… Expected Duration:** 6 weeks

As you progress in your AI journey, it's crucial to develop skills beyond just implementing models. While understanding machine learning and deep learning concepts is foundational, practical AI applications require additional expertise in research comprehension, model interpretation, and deployment. Knowing how to read and implement research papers also allows you to stay up to date with the latest advancements, enabling you to build upon existing methodologies rather than reinventing the wheel. Additionally, deploying models is essential for transitioning AI projects from theoretical implementations to real-world applications. Knowing how to deploy models ensures that your models are accessible, and usable in practical settings, whether through web applications, APIs, or cloud services. These projects are designed to equip you with these vital skills, helping you bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry readiness.

#### I. Paper Implementation

\
Implementing research papers is a critical skill for AI practitioners, as it allows to translate theoretical advancements into working models. AI research is rapidly evolving, and many of the latest breakthroughs originate from academic papers. By selecting and reproducing a paper, you gain hands-on experience with model architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. This process enhances your ability to comprehend complex ideas, troubleshoot implementation issues, and contribute to the AI research community. Additionally, documenting your implementation with well-structured code, dependencies, and results prepares you for collaborative projects and open-source contributions.

**ðŸ“Œ Tasks**

1. Select and implement an easy-to-medium-level research paper. You don't have to choose the same dataset used in the paper; instead, a public dataset of practical size from Kaggle or any other source will work.
2. Document your implementation with:
   1. Clear requirements.txt
   2. Setup instructions
   3. Training/inference code
   4. Performance metrics for the chosen dataset
3. Upload your work to GitHub with a detailed README, including environment setup, run instructions, trained model checkpoint download link and model performance visualisations.

\
Some good beginner-friendly papers you can check out for implementation are:

* "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks"
* "ResNet: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"

\
You are welcome to work on any other paper of similar difficulty that catches your eye.



#### II. Deployment Project

\
Building an AI model is just the beginning, deploying it is what makes it useful. Deployment bridges the gap between research and application, allowing models to be integrated into real-world systems. This project focuses on implementing an end-to-end AI solution that includes input data preprocessing, model selection, evaluation, and serving predictions through an accessible interface. Whether through web apps, APIs, or cloud-based solutions, deployment ensures that your model is not just a proof of concept but a usable tool. By working on this project, you'll gain experience with frameworks like Streamlit and Gradio, learn how to deploy models on cloud platforms and understand the challenges of scalability, latency, and user interaction.\

**ðŸ“Œ Tasks**\
Implement an AI project involving the deployment of a pre-trained model.

1. Select a pre-trained model from available model libraries like [HuggingFace Models](https://huggingface.co/models) or [timm](https://huggingface.co/docs/timm/index).
2. Use frameworks like Streamlit and Gradio to create an interactive UI for inputting data and displaying model outputs, or develop a custom web application with API endpoints for inference and UI.
3. Deploy the model on a free-tier cloud platform (e.g. Hugging Face Spaces).
4. Create a GitHub repository with comprehensive documentation covering:
   1. Project purpose
   2. Setup instructions and usage guide
   3. Performance metrics and insights

Example project: [Sentiment Analysis with BERT Model](https://github.com/abdeLKabir-56/Sentiment-Analysis-with-Transformers)
